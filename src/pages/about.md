I'm Chang, a data professional with 7+ years of experience working up and down the analytics stack within the tech industry.
Currently, I'm a analytics engineer/data scientist hybrid at [Modern Treasury](https://www.moderntreasury.com/).

When I'm not at work, you can find me:
- Volunteering with [SF YIMBY](https://www.sfyimby.org/)!
- Writing about Bay Area housing politics on my Substack - [Principled Agents](https://changsun.substack.com/)
- Taking photos, and then waiting months before [uploading them](https://www.instagram.com/changrybirds/)
- Adding to my ever-growing Kindle backlog
